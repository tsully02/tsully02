Hi, I'm Trevor!

I'm currently working on Project HAL at the Tufts Levin Lab (here's the work-in-progress [documentation](project-hybrot.github.io))

Here are some projects I've worked on:
  - [The Iris Language](https://github.com/The-Iris-Language/Iris)
  - [Tuftris](https://github.com/tsully02/Tuftris)
