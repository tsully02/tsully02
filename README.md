Hi, I'm Trevor!

I'm currently working at the Tufts Levin Lab on Project HAL (Holistic Agential Learning), a software for creating and running closed-loop experiment on MaxWell Biosystem's MaxOne and MaxTwo. Here's the work-in-progress [documentation](https://project-hal.github.io/).

Here are some other projects I've worked on:
  - [The Iris Language](https://github.com/The-Iris-Language/Iris)
  - [Tuftris](https://github.com/tsully02/Tuftris)
